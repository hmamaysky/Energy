Description:
------------
    This file takes in the calculated var coefs (from generate_model_coef.py) and aggregate them into one file.
    Then selects the stable models and saves them in a dictionary for each week.
    By stable, it means the coefs do not hit zero or change sign in the past several years 
    (specified by the researcher, see var 'lookback' in the main process). 
Note:
-----    
    Please modify the directories in the "read_and_integrate" function, the "main" function
    and the main process to generate desired results.
